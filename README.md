# sonar-slack-pusher
Jenkins plugin for pushing Sonar quality gate statuses to a given Slack channel.

The plugin runs as a post build action and runs no matter the outcome of the job. The plugin makes an API request to
a Sonar server instance to get all the metrics for a given job. If the sonar job has a quality gate defined and
linked to the project all the check given checks will be reported back if they 'fail'.

For a failed code coverage check it looks like this:

**Sonar job**
**Job:** _My project_
**Branch:** _master_
**DANGER**
**Quality gate:** _coverage_
**Reason:** _Coverage < 60_
**Value:** _29.0%_
