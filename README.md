# sonar-slack-pusher

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/andnyb/sonar-slack-pusher.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/andnyb/sonar-slack-pusher)

Jenkins plugin for pushing Sonar quality gate statuses to a given Slack channel.

The plugin runs as a post build action and runs no matter the outcome of the job. The plugin makes an API request to
a Sonar server instance to get all the metrics for a given job. If the sonar job has a quality gate defined and
linked to the project all the check given checks will be reported back if they 'fail'.

For a failed code coverage check it looks like this:

**Sonar job**

**Job:** _My project_

**Branch:** _master_

**DANGER**

**Reason:**
- _Coverage < 60_
- _Skipped unit tests > 0_
- _<another failed gate>_
